# CalendarRMI


● A method of creating such object-oriented distributed applications is through the usage of Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

● A single week's worth of events is displayed in a Java RMI-built calendar app prototype.

● Clients can add events to their own personal calendars, which they can access from their own separate instances of the calendar.

● When a client creates a public event, the server notifies all active client connections using Callback methods.

● If the other clients accept the invitation, the event is added to their calendars.
